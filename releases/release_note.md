Comment
============
I notice that some antivirus software reports risk of virus in putty-nd, and I do look into this.
It turns out that the listening to the keyboard feature when the term win is active and the ways to handle the w32sock api in putty will trigger that report.
The way to solve this is to apply a code sign certification which can identify the software is released by me.
But it can't prevent me to do evil things, which I won't, and I have to pay for it :-(. 
I am good at software design, but not good at business, no plan to make money from this. So I decide to leave as it is. 

From putty-nd2, putty.exe is released alone when other applications in putty suite is not changed.
Please download putty_suite_without_putty_exe.zip to make a complete putty suite.

Any comment is appreciated.

--------------------------------
putty6.0_nd1.11
--------------------------------
1. Other changes
    1. make it possible to change the tab title dynamically. How to do:
       a. un-tick setting Terminal->Featrues->Disable remote-controlled tab title...
       b. run cmd:PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;the_tab_title\007"'. The tab title can contain the system env, for example:
           PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOST}: ${PWD}\007"'
    2. a very good idea from Lokesh: One click logging feature to capture terminal prints. This modified code will have an option for capturing the onscreen prints to a log file. Even though this is already a feature of Putty in "logging" section but there is no straight forward mechanism to Start & Stop whenever required. So two options have been provided:
       a. A menu entry "Start Logging" when we right click anywhere inside terminal (for this to work "Selection" behaviour has to be "windows").
       b. A toolbar button ">" for Start & Stop Logging.
    3. more options for log file's name(&S for session name, and &P for the desktop path).
